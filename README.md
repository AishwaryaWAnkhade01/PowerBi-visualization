Hospital Readmission Data Analysis Dashboard


Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key trends in hospital readmission data. 
The dashboard covers patient demographics, diagnoses, hospital departments, time spent in the hospital, and more, all in a single interactive file.
Dashboard Features
The following insights are available within the dashboard:

Patient Demographics:

Breakdown of readmission rates by age, gender, and ethnic background.
Helps identify demographic groups most likely to be readmitted.
Diagnosis and Medical Specialties:

Analysis of the most common diagnoses leading to readmission.
Visualizations showing readmission rates by inpatient, outpatient, and emergency departments.
Average Time Spent in Hospital:

Displays the average duration of hospital stays for readmitted patients, segmented by age and diagnosis.
Procedures by Age Group:

Breakdown of medical procedures performed by age group, showing which treatments are common among different demographics.
Number of Medications Administered:

Visualization of the number of medications prescribed to patients during their hospital stay.

How to Use the Dashboard
Use the built-in filters to explore different age groups, hospital departments, and diagnoses.
Navigate through the various sheets to view different aspects of the data, such as demographics, hospital stays, or medical procedures.
Hover over the charts to view detailed data points and trends.

Key Insights
Older patients (ages 65+) experience longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates, particularly for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart conditions.
Outpatient services show the highest volume of younger patients, while inpatient services tend to handle more complex cases in older age groups.
Cardiology and internal medicine have the highest readmission rates across all hospital departments.

Future Enhancements
Add a predictive model to estimate readmission risk based on patient history.
Automate updates to the dashboard using Python to streamline analysis with new data
